### Chart 1
    
```{r}

Companies_with_most_complaints <- complaints %>% select(company) %>% 
                                group_by(company) %>%                                                 summarise(amount_complaints = n()) %>%                                 arrange(desc(amount_complaints))

Top3_complaints <- Companies_with_most_complaints %>% filter(amount_complaints>10000)

#the code above is isolating the company variable in the complaints dataset, we will use this simplified dataset to create a chart in plot_ly to visually show the top companies responsible for the complaints

fig1 <- plot_ly(data = Top3_complaints, x = ~amount_complaints, y = ~company, type = 'bar', name = '2020 Companies with the Most Complaints')

fig1 <- fig1 %>% layout(
                title = "2020 Companies with the Most Complaints",
                xaxis = list(title = "Number of Complaints"),
                yaxis = list(title = "")
)

fig1

#code above makes a bar graph which shows the three companies with the most complaints; I had trouble with making the companies themselves readable, but if you hover over the bars they pop up... maybe we could discuss this in class?

### Chart 2
    
```{r}
#data prep - borrowed from initial analysis markdown file

company_response <- complaints %>% 
  select(company_response_to_consumer) %>% 
  group_by(company_response_to_consumer) %>% 
  summarise(r = n()) 

company_response_clean <- filter(company_response, r > 1)

#data visualization - donut chart to show the percentage of company responses to complaints

fig3 <- company_response_clean %>% plot_ly(labels = 
                    ~company_response_to_consumer, values = ~r)

fig3 <- fig3 %>% add_pie(hole = 0.6)

fig3 <- fig3 %>% layout(
                  title = "How companies respond to complaints",  
                  showlegend = F,

                               showticklabels = FALSE))
fig3

#experiencing a similar issue to fig1 where it is difficult to read some of the numbers without hovering over... not sure how to fix the situation
